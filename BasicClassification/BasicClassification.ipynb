    "The UC Irvine machine learning data repository hosts a famous dataset, the Pima Indians dataset, on whether a patient has diabetes originally owned by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and donated by Vincent Sigillito. You can find it at  https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data. This data has a set of attributes of patients, and a categorical variable telling whether the patient is diabetic or not. For several attributes in this data set, a value of 0 may indicate a missing value of the variable. It has a total of 768 data-points. \n",

You will install SVMLight, which you can find at http://svmlight.joachims.org, to train and evaluate an SVM to classify this data.\n",

On the other hand, it is unnecessary to compute and store $p(x_i^{(j)}|y)$ in order to find $\\log p(x_i^{(j)}|y)$; you can write $\\log p(x_i^{(j)}|y)$ as a direct function of $\\mu_y$, $\\sigma_y$ and the features.
